## Elaboration
C was originally designed for and implemented on the [`UNIX`](./unix/README.md) OS on the [`PDP-11`](./PDP-11/README.md), by Dennis Ritchie.
Production compilers also exist for several other machines, including the [`IBM System/370`](./IBM-system-370/README.md), the [`Honeywall 600`](./honeywall-600/README.md) and the [`Interdata 8/32`](./interdata-8/32).
