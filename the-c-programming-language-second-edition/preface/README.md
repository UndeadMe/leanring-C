## Important stuff
C was originally designed for and implemented on the [`UNIX`](../research/unix/README.md) OS on the [`PDP-11`](./PDP-11/pdp-11.md), by Dennis Ritchie.
Production compilers also exist for several other machines, including the [`IBM System/370`](./IBM-system-370/IBM-system-370.md), the [`Honeywall 6000`](./honeywall-600/honeywall-6000.md) and the [`Interdata 8/32`](./interdata-8-32/interdata-8-32.md).
