## Data Types and Sizes
There are only a few basic data types in C:
- char
- int
- float
- double
in addition, there are number of qualifiers that can be applied to these basic types. `short` and `long` apply to integers:
```C
short int sh;
long int counter;
```
the qualifier `signed` or `unsigned` may be applied to `char` or any `integer`. `unsigned` numbers are always positive or zero.
