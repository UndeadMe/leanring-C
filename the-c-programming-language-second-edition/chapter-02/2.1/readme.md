## Variable Names
- Names are made up of letters and digits; the first character must be letter.
- the underscore "_" counts as a letter; it is sometimes useful for imporoving the readability of long variable names. don't begin variable names.
- upper case and lower case letters are distinct, so `x` and `X` are two different names.
- traditional C practice is to use lower case for variable names, and all upper case for `symbolic constants`.
