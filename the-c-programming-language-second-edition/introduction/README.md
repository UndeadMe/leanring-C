- Many of the important ideas of `C` stem from the language `BCPL`, developed by `Martin Richards`. The influence of `BCPL` proceeded indirectly through the language `B`, which was written by `Ken Thopson` in 1970 for the first `UNIX` system on the `DEC` `PDP-7`.
- `BCPL` and `B` are `typeless` languages.
